# Boids

This is an implementation of Craig Reynolds' boids algorithm described in [pseudocode](http://www.kfish.org/boids/pseudocode.html). This was mainly just done for a short coding excercise (1 day), the routines is in dire need of optimization.

Check the [live demo](http://jiekebo.github.io/boids/)

Main focus was on getting requestAnimationFrame right, which seems to work fine, although [this](http://impactjs.com/forums/impact-engine/misuse-of-requestanimationframe) describes a problem the code might have.

Feel free to leave comments or create pull-requests, any input is welcome! I'm always looking for ways to improve.
